# Devil's Grip

This JavaScript React app allows you to play the solitaire card game Devil's Grip in a web browser.

To run the app, once you get a local copy of the repository you can use the following commands.

On the client side:

```javascript
npm install
```

```javascript
npm start
```

On the server side:

```javascript
npm install
```

```javascript
npm run seeds
```

```javascript
npm run server:dev
```

Eventually, go to <em>localhost:3000</em> to play the game in your browser. You will find the rules in the home page.
